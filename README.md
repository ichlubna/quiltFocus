# Generator of focus maps from holographic data

This tool generates focus maps from holographic data that are already focused either by translation of the images or by intentional rendering with a tilt shift of the optical axis. The focused area is defined as a region of pixels where the same spot in the 3D scene is positioned at the same pixel coordinates in all the input views. Usage example is in the generateMap.sh script.
